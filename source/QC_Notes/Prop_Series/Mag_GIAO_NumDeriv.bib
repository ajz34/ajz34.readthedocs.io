  journal     = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {We describe an accurate and scalable implementation for the computation of molecular nuclear magnetic resonance shieldings, J-couplings, and magnetizabilities within nonrelativistic semilocal density functional theory, based on numeric atom-centered orbital (NAO) basis sets. We compare the convergence to the basis set limit for two established types of NAO basis sets, called NAO-VCC-nZ and FHI-aims-09, to several established Gaussian-type basis sets. The basis set limit is reached faster for the NAO basis sets than for standard correlation consistent Gaussian-type basis sets (cc-pVnZ, aug-cc-pVnZ, cc-pCVnZ, aug-cc-pCVnZ). For shieldings, the convergence properties and accuracy of the NAO-VCC-nZ basis sets are similar to Jensen's polarization consistent (pc) basis sets optimized for shieldings (pcS-n). For J-couplings, we develop a new type of NAO basis set (NAO-J-n) by augmenting the NAO-VCC-nZ basis sets with tight s-functions from Jensen's pcJ-n basis sets, which are optimized for J-couplings. We find the convergence of the NAO-J-n to be similar to the pcJ-n basis sets. Large scale applicability of the implementation is demonstrated for shieldings and J-couplings in a system of over 1,000 atoms.},
